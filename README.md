# Game Plan
Our video game is a web based game written in javascript that is based around the idea of parkour. The main goal of the game is an endless random multiplayer online runner game, with a quick and basic tutorial that teaches the basic mechanics of the game. The endless runner will be based down a mountain slope, on which there are several snowballs forming. Among these snowballs are yourself, and the other online players. Other players can crash into you, and depending on if you have a larger amount of mass, you lose a chunk of your mass.As you roll down this hill, you get bigger, get faster, and get a higher score. If you hit a tree, you lose a chunk of your snowball, or health. Once your snowball is too small, the game will make you restart, with the amount of mass that everyone starts with. When buying things with points, you also sacrifice your mass. This slows you down, but different bonuses come with these boosts. Some, for example might decrease the mass you lose on hit with a tree, or increase the base speed of your ball. This game will be targeted towards friend groups that don't have high quality computers but still want to play games together, or friends aren’t on their normal computer.
